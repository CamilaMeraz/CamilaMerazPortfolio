        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="background-text">
            My professional journey has been defined by a deep commitment to fostering authentic connections and advancing inclusive practices in marketing
            and communications. Through my academic achievements and hands-on experience, I have honed my ability to craft strategies that amplify diverse
            voices and resonate with multicultural audiences.
        </p>

        <p class="background-text">
            My passion lies at the intersection of creativity, advocacy, and leadership—a combination that drives my work to inspire meaningful change.
            From developing strategic recruitment plans that increased applicant numbers for leadership programs, to creating inclusive brand messaging
            for fashion events, I have consistently leveraged my communication and marketing expertise to build bridges between diverse communities and
            the brands or organizations I represent.
        </p>

        <p class="background-text">
            My thesis, D&Ivertising: Gen Z and Brand Loyalty, explored how authenticity in Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) practices fosters lasting relationships with younger generations.
            It reflects my belief that brands must move beyond performative efforts and embrace real representation to cultivate trust and loyalty. This work aligns seamlessly with my passion
            for consumer psychology, storytelling, and cultural competency.
            In every role I have undertaken, I have prioritized collaboration and innovation. Whether developing leadership curriculums that celebrate cultural identity or creating targeted
            marketing campaigns that engage audiences, I bring a people-first approach to my work.
        </p>

        <p class="background-text">
            My experiences as a Communications Consultant, Event Manager, and Marketing Intern have strengthened
            my ability to adapt, lead, and deliver impactful projects in dynamic, fast-paced environments.
            I am excited to continue my journey as a champion for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the communications landscape. By combining strategic insight, cultural awareness, and a genuine
            desire to connect, I strive to make every project an opportunity to create progress and amplify underrepresented voices.
